# CPP MODULES

## OVERVIEW

This repository includes the various C++ modules from 42 curriculum. Each module introduces us to new concepts and ways of working with C++.
Up until this point all our projects have been written in C with multiple constraints whereas we have a lot more freedom in approaching the challenges of these C++ projects.

## GOALS
### CPP00
0. Capitalize the input received as arguments.
1. Create a phonebook which stores up to 8 contacts. Entering more contacts will overwrite the indices starting from the beginning.
2. Create a file (Account.cpp) which will replicate the output as shown in the log file.

### CPP01
0. Implement a class which will announce itself when instantiated.
1. Following the previous exercise, create a funtion which will allocate N amount of classes.
2. Introduction to references and comparing their use to variables and pointers.
3. Create three classes, HumanA will take in the Weapon class in it's constructor whereas HumanB may be instantiated without said class. Changing the Weapon class should reflect the same changes in the Human classes.
4.
